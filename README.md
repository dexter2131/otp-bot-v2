ðŸ”§FIXED THE NOT AUTORIZED ERROR @username_to_id_bot GET USER ID FROM BOT TO MAKE YOU ADMIN AND FILL IN WHEN PROMPT 
I Removed it when Removing Auto updater Its Init Now 
So Whit new file everybody can use it Just copy past your settings.cfg file in it 
and run it and input your user id NOT YOUR CHAT_ID BUT USER_ID @username_to_id_bot


Step 1: Download and setup ngrok and run it "ngrok http 5000" and copy the forward url to settings.cfg
DO NOT CLOSE DOWN NGROK KEEP OPEN UNTILL YOU CLOSE DOWN OTP_BOT SERVER
EverTime you CLOSE NGROK YOU WILL HAVE TO EDIT SETTINGS.CFG

Step2: go on telegram to BotFather make a bot & copy the bot api to settings.cfg "TELEGRAM_BOT_URL" go back to the bot and start it 

Step3: go to settings file and fill in twilio credentials

step4: run the OTPbot File

step5: get your user id from @username_to_id_bot And Fill in Command Prompt OF OF THE OTP_BOT SOFTWARE

step6: go to telegram SMS BOT you Just created with step2 and press /start
